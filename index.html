  <p>We live in a society where people say money is everything. people think money equals happiness. We as a society have to change the way we think about happiness. Happiness does not come from materialistic things or the Dollar. Happiness comes from within. Dont live your life chasing money thinking it will make you happy, and in the process of chasing the dollar, you might forget to live. Money is a peice of Paper, with no real value! Like the legend Bob Marley once said, “Money is numbers and numbers never end. If it takes money to be happy, your search for happiness will never end.”

  <p>Yes i agree, we need MONEY to live a good life, to pay the bills, to put food on the table, to go on vacations etc. Society needs to stop equating having lots of money to happiness. Ive been around millionaires that are miserable, they have all the money in the world, but arent Happy!!! Ive been around people with little or No money and they ARE HAPPY with what they have, even though it is not much. MONEY DOES NOT AND WILL NEVER BUY HAPPINESS. Happiness comes from within.</p>
